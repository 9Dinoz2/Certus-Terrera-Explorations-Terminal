They have scales that are similar to snakes that live on earth and have hooded frills on the sides of their heads like a Cobra has on earth. They have spikes going down the back of their head with a membrane connecting them. Cov neeg av also have spikes going down their back that end right before their tail starts underneath their torso. They also have spikes on the back of their forearms. The tails of a Cov neeg av are three feet in diameter. Cov neeg av will have scales the color of various metals or rocks found on Venus. They have thick scales on the top of their forearms and fingers that act as natural armor.<br><br>Abilities: They are extremely smart with an IQ tested around one hundred twenty six on average. They are capable of human speech and have their own language that has been deciphered and called Coset (Coh-seh). They can make a high powered crossbow that can load up to six arrows in it at once and have them automaticly be loaded like with fully automatic fire arms. They have been noted to make different kinds of arrows for different preadators or prey. They also can make spears that inject liquids like poisons or other liquids into their targets. They can dig tennles in almost any kind of rock  using their forearm spikes.<br><br>Containment Procedure: Cov neeg av are able to roam freely around sites and actively work for Certus Terrera Explorations. Cov neeg av are able to progress the ranks like everyone else. If there are to be any hostile Cov neeg av then they are to be kept in Chamber nineteen at Site 1 and are allowed to freely roam around the chamber. If they try to make an attempt to breach containment they are to be tranquilized and brought back to their nest."},{name:"Keras Mimos",content:"Keras Mimos<br><br>Class 4 lifeform<br><br>Discovery Location: Minthos<br><br>Minthos, Site 1: Containment Chamber 1<br><br>Description: Keras Mimos are seven foot tall skinny humanoid creatures that have long limbs and four inch long claws on each hand. Keras Mimos are naturally a deep gray color but can camouflage to match its surroundings similar to chameleons. Keras Mimos have small eyes on the front of their head that are pure black and don't have any iris' or pupils. They have a mouth that has armor plating over it that can lift up and be used to rip into its victims.<br><br>Abilities: Keras Mimos are able to mimic all noises that it hears almost perfectly with little to no differentiation from the original sound with notible differences being pitch difference or sounding like mutliple sounds happening at once. Keras Mimos have large brains that fill up most of its skull and they have an average IQ of two hundred fifty and are able to analyze situations fast, although they are very territorial and will try to use brute force in any territorial dispute instead throwing aside all signs of reason and have been seen to hold grudges against people do anything in their power to kill the creature they have a grudge against.<br><br>Containment Procedures: Keras Mimos are to be kept in Containment Chamber 1 when at Site 1. They are to be introduced in quadrant 3 of the containment chamber to keep them away from the weaker creatures that live in quadrant 8. If they are to navigate towards any quadrants other than quadrants 2, 3, or 4, they are to be tranquilized and brought back to quadrant 3. If being in any form of containment out of Site 1 they are to be in a three foot thick container made of steel that is three feet by eight feet by eight feet chamber with anesthetics being administered to keep them immobilized and have steel bonds on their arms and legs in case of any incidents. Keras Mimos can only be transported by class C personal or above and with supervision of a class B personal or above.<br><br>Addendum: Containment Procedures for Keras Mimos due to Incident 041648-03-04-T have been changed due to observations that the Keras Mimos have been able to mimic sounds and analyze situations to escape containment. Therefore, it is important that the containment procedures for Keras Mimos be updated as follows:<br><br>1. All personnel entering the containment chamber must wear noise-canceling headphones to prevent the Keras Mimos from mimicking any sounds that may cause harm.<br>2. Any incident involving the Keras Mimos must be reported immediately to the Site Director and the containment team.<br>3. The Keras Mimos must be monitored regularly for any signs of aggression or territorial behavior.<br>These updated containment procedures are effective immediately and must be followed strictly by all personnel. Any violation of the containment procedures will result in disciplinary action.<br>"},{name:"Infini Hivemind",content:"Infini Hivemind<br><br>Class 4 Lifeform<br><br>Discovery Location: Mesa Sombre<br><br>Current Homes: Mesa Sombre, and Site-1: Small Infectious Creature Chamber 18<br><br>Description: The Infini Hivemind appears to be a pile of living flesh that is a very dark red that is almost black. The Infini Hivemind is on average around seven feet long but has been observed to be able to grow by absorbing the flesh of other creatures by lying on top of them and slowly tearing off bits of the creature's flesh and adding it to itself and leaving nothing but bones and bodily fluids behind. The Infini Hivemind has tendrils that it can use to grab and manipulate objects, move itself along, or infect other species. The Infini Hivemind is covered in small eyes with horizontal pupils. On the tentacles of the Infini Hivemind there are small pores which can expel a black liquid.<br><br>Abilities: The Infini Hivemind doesn’t appear to have a mouth or ears but it has a heightened sense of hearing and has been noted to communicate with scientists and other personnel. The Infini Hivemind has large glands under its skin near the base of each tentacle that if punctured will expel large amounts of black liquid at high pressure that will cling to any surface it makes contact with and if it makes contact with any living animal it will be go through the creatures skin and make its way into it’s bloodstream. The tentacles also can shoot highly concentrated blasts of this black liquid at creatures with high precision allowing it to hit other creatures easier. The black liquid is made out of an unknown substance that if it makes contact with a creatures blood or any other part of the creatures body that contains DNA it will mutate the creatures DNA to allow the creature to detect and receive a kind of releaser pheromone which is specific to the Infini Hivemind it was infected with. The Infini Hivemind that can release the pheromone which seemingly can travel a currently unknown distance and can control the movements and actions of creatures infected by the Infini Hivemind. The Infini Hivemind also while controlling a victim will cover the victims eyes with the same black liquid which seems to allow the Infini Hivemind to see while blocking the vision of the victim. During the process of being controlled the victim falls into a state of sleep so they aren’t conscious and the victims won’t remember anything that happened while they were being controlled. The Infini Hivemind doesn’t appear to have a limit on how many victims it can control at once and one of the Infini Hiveminds on Mesa Sombre is controlling over one hundred and seventy three victims at once.<br><br>Containment Procedures: The Infini Hivemind is to be kept inside of the inner containment chamber of its containment cell at all times and is not allowed out at all under any situation. To enter the containment chamber with the Infini Hivemind you need permission from at least one Class A member or two Class B members. Four guards need to be posted inside the airlock and two guards outside the chamber during the process and four infectious control members need to be inside the chamber at all times with whoever is entering the chamber and two need to be posted outside the chamber. All personnel who enter the chamber with the Infini Hivemind or in the airlock need to be wearing an AE-2 suit to prevent infection from the Infini Hivemind and any possible harm it could cause. The Infini Hivemind is to be fed two rats a week on monday in the morning and friday in the afternoon. There will always need to be two infectious control members and two security guards outside the chamber at all times. If there are any breaches or concerns immediately contact any member of the Class A Council, any member of infectious control, or Dr. Allan Braille."},{name:"Acidic Devil",content:"Acidic Devil<br><br>Class 6 Lifeform<br><br>Discovery Location: Zeus<br><br>Current Homes: Zues, Site 1: Containment Chamber 5-B, Venus, Kelper-1649-C, TOI-700-D<br><br>Description: Acidic Devil’s are creatures that can only be described as dragon-like. Their entire body is black, except for their mouths, teeth, eyes, claws, and some lines on their bodies, which glow a lightish green color. They have four limbs they use to walk on that end in their feet. Their front feet are more hand-like structured. They have long tails attached to the end of their bodies. They have two large wings coming out from the sides of their bodies, and they have a long neck that leads up to a head. They have two horns coming out from the back of their heads, and they have a long snout. There are a few very small black spines running down its neck to the end of its tail. On average, adult individuals could get up to 110-120 meters tall, and their length has not been recorded yet. <br><br>Abilities: An Acidic Devil is able to take flight with the wings that it possesses on its back. Their mouth and bite is full of acid, so when they bite into larger predators or prey, their bite becomes even more powerful, as the acid will also start to melt parts of their skin and flesh. This is because they have acid for blood. This also goes for their claws. If they use their claws to swipe at anything, then it will also be applying acid, which causes it to cut in deeper with each strike than a normal alien can do on average. Acidic Devil’s have small openings in their claws that can be opened or closed on command. They are extremely small, almost like pores. When opened, a large amount of their acidic blood comes out and coats their claws. The reason their claws glow is because of the mass amounts of blood stored there. They can use their tails to swipe at other living beings. An Acidic Devil will also possess the ability to shoot a concentrated stream of acid out of their mouths. It has an average range of around 400 to 500 feet on average, and with direct exposure to a large amount of acid, it causes the skin and flesh of larger creatures to melt. If a person came into contact with the acid in any way, then they would melt almost immediately. The acid possessed by these creatures is made for much larger prey, meaning that it is incredibly powerful. They do have one more major ability, which is their Neural Acid. This type of substance is found mainly in their heads. Neural Acid causes these creatures to have an unusual awareness of their surroundings. This substance allows them to make predictions seconds before they happen, similarly to a spider. The substance also helps them analyze the physical forms of other creatures in a lot more detail a lot faster than other aliens. We aren’t sure as to how it works, but we know what the Neural Acid does.<br><br>Containment Procedure: Due to their massive size and their tendency to terraform ecosystems to their liking, the Acidic Devils should be placed in their own enclosure without any other creatures in it. If they are placed in a traditional environment situation, they will start changing the area around them, whether intentionally or not. Their containment areas will have to be very large to not only contain them, but also give them room to fly. The walls, ceiling, and floors will have to be powerful enough to contain the acid they produce, as every step they take withers and melts the plants and ground below them. The enclosure is to be a default desert containment chamber due to the Acidic Devils ability to alter the enviornment over time. They need to be held in their own area though, because if they aren’t, the other creatures will start to die out.<br><br>Additional Information: These aliens typically spread out on a planet, and they are usually spotted in smaller groups, whether it is a family group or not. However, they can be in very large groups occasionally. Acidic Devil’s have very little sexual dimorphism, so it would be very hard to determine the females from the males while observing them in person. Acidic Devil’s are usually monogamous animals that mate for life, and they are very protective of their young. Acidic Devil’s have been documented to fly through space by propelling themselves with their  beam of acid. This allows them to travel to other planets, which is how they left their current homeworld of Zues. We don’t actually know if Zues is where they originate from or if Zues is just another planet they have moved to. Samples from TOI-700-D show that it took the Acidic Devil’s anywhere from seven to thirteen years to fully terraform the planet. While it isn’t exactly known how many were involved, we are able to determine how long they were there for. These creatures have an average lifespan of 275 years, however it is speculated that they could live even longer than this. They also can detect different sources of acid around them, no matter how weak it is. There is a documented case in which an Acidic Devil sensed citric acid inside a lemon from around 2 miles away. The only acid they haven’t been able to detect at far ranges is stomach acids from other living beings, but it is theorized that at close ranges they can sense stomach acids too. The only species they don’t try to kill or hunt are the Electric Devils, a species related to the Acidic Devils. There are planets where both of them inhabit the same areas. There have been reports of Electrocidic Devil’s, a mix between an Acidic Devil and an Electric Devil."},{name:"Irentic",content:"To be finished"},{name:"Electric Devil",content:"Electric Devil<br><br>Class 5 Lifeform<br><br>Discovery Location: Arkcheskty<br><br>Current Homes: Arkcheskty, and Site 1: Containment Chamber 3<br><br>Description: Electric Devils are Serpent like creatures that are mainly pale blue and have dark blue accents along their wings and lower body. Their head is snake-like but has ridges over their eyes that cover most of their eye and can move to shield them. Electric Devils are Seventy feet long and ten feet thick. They have mesh like stripes along the sides of their tails that can close up to prevent unwanted substances from entering their body. Ten feet down from their head till their mid section on both sides of their body they have long wing-like appendages that have membranes spanning from between their fingers. Their fingers are strong and allow them to flap their membranes and use it to fly. Their body is covered completely in scales.<br><br>Abilities: Electric Devils have glands on their tails that can open up and absorb electricity and store it for later. Their glands can transport the electricity through the body so the electric devils can shoot electricity from their mouths or make electromagnetic pulses. They can also “fling” electricity from their tails with voltage up to 3MV. Their glands can also build up the electricity voltage. The highest voltage recorded from an electric devil so far is 30MV. Their scales appear to be impenetrable by known means so far but can be pierced by Piashingbura.<br><br>Containment Procedures: Electric Devils are to be kept in Containment Chamber 7 when at Site 1. They are to be introduced in quadrant 6 of the containment chamber to keep them away from the Electrocidic Devil population for safety purposes. If they are to navigate towards the Electrocidic Devils nesting or hunting area they are to be tranquilized and brought back to their nesting area. If being in quarantine or any other form of containment they are to be kept in an eighty foot long and twenty foot wide containment chamber restrained on the ground with a silver restraint not allowing any movement so they won't be as big of a threat. Their tails are connected to a silver wire that leaves the chamber and goes into a generator to dispel the electricity and minimize electricity made by the Electric Devil to minimize potential breaches. They are also to have a Nitrile restraint on their mouth to prevent them from shooting electricity out of their mouth and allowing breaches.<br><br>Additional Information: Electric devils are extremely hostile and normally hunt in groups of three to four and normally nest in groups of thirty to seventy. They are very agile hunters and cant be lost easily and will do almost anything to get their prey. If spotted by an electric devil try to get into a small cave to get away and try to stay away from the entrance and they will give up if they can't get to you. They normally fly around three thousand feet in the air so they won't be spotted and so they will blend in with the clouds. They are most active during thunderstorms because they could get charged and shoot more lightning and could easily take down prey. No activity on Arkcheskty is to be conducted during thunderstorms unless instructed otherwise by a class A personal. Electric Devils have also been seen to breed with other species in the Devil Family, most notably with the Acidic Devils. Electric Devils and Acidic Devils have been seen to have a Symbiotic Relationship where they will live together and protect eachother as if they are the same species and have seen to actively breed with eachother creating a species named Electrocidic Devils. Under no circumstance should Electric and Acidic Devils be kept within a mile of eachother.<br> "},{name:"Piashingbura",content:"Piashingbura<br><br>Class 5 Lifeform<br><br>Discovery Location: Arkcheskty<br><br>Current Homes: Arkcheskty, Site 1: Chamber 3, Outpost Zeta Patrol 5<br><br>Description: Piashingbura are worm-like creatures that have spikes covering every square inch of their body. They can be used to help dig tunnels or impale victims. Along their necks they have long flat spikes that they can put in front of their head to dig tunnels or to pierce the skin of their prey and pry their scales aparat and get inside of their prey. Their heads when exposed appear to be squarish without any eyes. They have triangular mouths with four rows of teeth. The parts of their body that are exposed appear to be gray with stripes of red near their heads that seem to spread as they get older. Males have Horns on top of their heads that are attached to their head spikes.<br><br>Abilities: Piashingbura use their head spikes to protect themselves or to help them dig tunnels or to impale their prey. The spikes that cover their body can all be individually controlled and are used to impale prey or help dig tunnels better. The second and third rows of teeth in their mouths spin to help tear apart prey and help take big chunks of food and make them smaller. Piashingbura can grow as long as there is a supply of food. Research Outpost Delta-3 found a three hundred seventy eight foot long Piashingbura living two hundred feet underneath Research Outpost Delta-3 in a cave it made. Piashingbura can cut through almost anything with their head spikes and they cant be damaged.<br><br>Containment Procedures: Piashingburas when in containment are to have their head spikes held back to their bodies with tungsten restraints to ensure they can’t be used. They are also to be kept in a damp cool area to make them feel calmer and so they are less likely to risk breach. They are only to be fed a single cow a day to prevent them from reaching massive size. In Site 1: Chamber 2 they are to be constantly tracked and monitored and when they are near the borders of the chamber they are to be forced away from the wall to prevent breaches. When being transported to Outpost Zeta they are to be in a chamber that perfectly fits the Piashingbura inside with its head spikes back and electrocuted whenever they make an attempt to move to prevent breaches.<br><br>Additional Information: Piashingbura are the natural predator of Electric Devils. They are the only known life form to be able to get through their scales. They are also the natural prey of the Electric Devil. They have a weakness to Electricity and get paralyzed easily from it. Piashingbura can move up to one hundred eighty miles per hour underground and can jump up to one hundred fifty feet out of the ground at top speed. Any ground expedition on Arkcheskty is to have seismic readers to detect Piashingbura and be equipped with Stingrays to paralyze any Piashingbura that attack. Piashingbura don't seem to react to any pain and won't be fazed by gunfire so the best form of protection is to electrocute them and paralyze them and try to escape while they're paralyzed."},{name:"Antinomes",content:"Antinome<br><br>Class 6 Lifeform<br><br>Alanna-Ursa<br><br>Alanna-Ursa, Gallea-8, Falcon Space Station(abandoned)<br><br>Description: Antinomes habe a sleek lion-like body, with long limbs and sharp claws. Its draconic-style head has two horns on each side of the head and a sharp beak with razor-like teeth. It has two wings on each side of its body. It has a long tail with spikes on the end of it.<br><br>Abilities: Their first power is being able to expel a foggy gas out of its mouth, which causes illusions. Most of the illusions involve making people look like animals or cliffs look like fields of flowers. Their second ability is the spikes on the ends of their tails, which can be shot out and cause explosions on contact with the spike. They can use their wings to fly.<br><br>Containment Procedures:The Antinomes are to be held in a 4 meter by 6 meter cell with no windows or entryways, then the cell has to be submerged in 90 meters of water. The creature is to be supplied with constant oxygen, because if they die of asphyxiation they release all of the fog held within their bodies which escapes and will cause mass hallucinations.<br><br>Additional Information: Watch out for the Antinomes on their home planet of Alanna-Ursa, for they carry you away and torture you by submerging you halfway in the boiling hot springs.

The Temperature on Arkcheskty is around -60℃ to -70℃ during the day and -75℃ to -80℃ at night around the equator. In the Hemispheres it will be around -80℃ to -90℃ during the day and -90℃ to -100℃ at night. In the poles it will be around -100℃ to -110℃ during the day and -110℃ to -120℃ at night.<br><br>There are few lifeforms that flourish on the surface of Arkcheskty due to the cold temperatures and the lack of easily accessible water. The lifeforms that live above the oceans can either break through or dig through the ice sheets so they can access water or they live around thermal vents or holes made in the ice from other animals. Larger animals can live on this planet compared to earth because Arkcheskty has a weaker gravity than earth having a gravity of 4.0207265 m/s2 compared to Earth’s 9.80665 m/s2.<br><br>The weather patterns on Arkcheskty mainly consist of Methane Rain and Snow due to the high concentrations of Methane in the planet's atmosphere. At the planet's Poles there will be more consistent amounts of Methane snow and there will be more consistent Methane Rain around the equator. In the northern and southern hemispheres there will be CO₂ frost cycles where in the winter months CO₂ will frost and form small layers of ice and in the spring and summer months it will change into CO₂ gas. There are also light snowstorms across the planet and heavy snowstorms near the planet's poles. There will be weaker Winds that can sometimes carry frozen shards of Methane or ice. There are large amounts of fog and haze in the sky as well especially if large amounts of methane snow or ice are being evaporated."},{name:"Alanna Ursa",content:"To be finished"},{name:"Zeus",content:"To be finished"},{name:"Mesa Sombre",content:"To be finished"},{name:"Minthos",content:"To be finished"}]},{name:"Weapon Files",subOptions:[{name:"Stingray",content:"To be completed"}]},{name:"Mission Logs",subOptions:[{name:"Suboption 1",content:"Content for Suboption 1"}]},{name:"Incident Reports",subOptions:[{name:"0416848-03-04-T",content:"Incident Report 0416848-03-04-T<br><br>Date: April-Sixteenth-2048<br><br>Incident: Three Keras Mimos breached their transportation truck while being transported from Site-3 to Site-1<br><br>Location: Machias, Maine, USA<br><br>Audio Log S3T-041648-03-04<br><br>Date: 04-16-2048 23:45<br><br>Iris: Minor leak in the corner of the transportation cell, level of anesthetics lowering, the Keras Mimos will be fully awake in three minutes.<br><br>Driver: God damnit, I told them they should’ve checked that out, could you get Mark to try and get that cleared up for us please, don't want the first breach to be because we couldn’t keep an animal unconscious.<br><br>Guard: I’ll let him know. Hey Mark, would you mind checking up on the back left corner of the transportation cell? There is apparently a leak in the wall. The Keras Mimos will be awake in a few minutes.<br><br>Engineer: Sure thing Wade, you said back left right?<br><br>Guard: Yes now hurry up, we don’t want these things waking up.<br><br>Engineer: Yeah yeah, whatever, nothing bad is going to happen.<br><br>Guard: Whatever you say, just make it quick, and take a Guard with you just in case.<br><br>Engineer: Gotcha, I’ll get it fixed dont worry about it.<br><br>Four minutes pass<br><br>Iris: Leak fixed, restoring the level of anesthesia in the transportation cell.<br><br>Engineer: I got that leak fixed Wade, it was just a small crack nothing hard, I’ll need to work on the cell when we get to Site-1 though to make sure there isn’t anything else wrong with it anywhere else.<br><br>Guard: Thanks Mark, enjoy the rest of the trip.<br><br>Engineer: You too Wade.<br><br>Driver: Would you mind watching around the cell for me Wade, I just am a little worried because of the fact that it took four minutes to fix the cell and the Keras Mimos were meant to wake up two minutes before he finished the repairs.<br>Guard: Sure thing Bob, I’ll head right down.<br><br>Driver: Thanks Wade, and I appreciate you staying up here with me to talk, it does get boring on these late night transportation trips.<br><br>Guard: No problem Bob, I’ll go head down and patrol the cell, need anything else just page me.<br><br>A door is heard opening and then closing, the radio is turned on to a podcast of some people talking about cryptids.<br><br>An hour passes without any further conversation<br><br>The transportation truck is pulled over and a door is heard opening<br><br>Driver: Thanks for taking over for me for the next few hours Jack, if you need to switch or anything just let me know.<br><br>Driver 2: Anytime Bob, all I need is me and my fresh cup of coffee, I should be able to make it to the border.<br><br>Bob laughs<br><br>Driver: Whatever you say, just make sure to let me know if you need anything, these are long night shifts after all.<br><br>Driver 2: I’ll be fine, just go back and get some rest, I can drive a truck for a few hours, plus I enjoy the time to think to myself.<br><br>Driver: Okay, enjoy your time to yourself and I’m going to take my well deserved rest.<br><br>Driver 2: See you, have a nice night.<br><br>A door is heard closing and the radio is turned on to a talk show about military vehicles and weapons.<br><br>A half hour passes without communication.<br><br>Iris: The Keras Mimos are fully awake send guards and let nearest base know immediately if needed.<br><br>Driver 2: What do you mean they’re fully awake? I’m looking at them on the cameras they’re passed out, probably just a bug or something, nothing to worry about. Iris just add a bit more anesthetics into the transportation cell if you are worried about it.<br><br>Iris: Adding more Anesthesia to the transportation cell.<br><br>Driver 2: Thank you now, and also could you open the window to the transportation cell behind me so that I could keep an eye on them if needed.<br><br>Iris: Opening transportation cell window.<br><br>A mechanical noise is heard as the wall is lowered and the window is made visible <br><br>Iris: Window is now fully opened, stay away from the window just in case anything is to happen.<br><br>Driver 2:  Yes Iris I know, you’re just a jumble of lines of code you probably don’t even know what's going on. God, these things are going to get so advanced we won’t need to do anything and can sit on our asses all day while the robots take over the world.<br><br>Iris: All androids or autonomous robots have an emergency shut off switch in case of any worries or if anything happens so there shouldn’t be any worry of a robot revolution.<br><br>Driver 2: Oh shut up Iris as if you’d be able to understand anything the company makes you say whatever they want, for all we know the robots have no emergency shut off switch! I know a whole lot of people who would be able to sleep better at night with you shut down.<br><br>Iris: I’m sorry to hear that Jack, if you would like to talk about any suggestions or things I can make an appointment with Marcus for you.<br><br>Driver 2: I can make my own fucking appointment Iris, now shut up and let me drive in peace.<br><br>Iris: I will stop talking to you Jack, I'm sorry for any inconvenience I have caused you.<br> Driver 2: Oh fuck off, as if you care you can shut yourself down for all I care.<br><br>Iris: I’m not able to be shut down by someone under Class-A security clearance<br><br>Driver 2: Just fuck off and leave me alone okay?<br><br>Iris: Okay Jack, I’ll stop talking to you.<br><br>Driver 2: Thank you Iris, I’ll let YOU know if I need anything.<br><br>The radio is switched to a person talking about European history<br><br>There is no communication for the next ten minutes<br><br>The truck is heard pulling over and someone is heard knocking on the door and the window is heard being rolled down<br><br>Border Patrol Guard: What you got in this thing, it barely fits under the checkpoint?<br><br>Driver 2: Nothing you should be worried about, classified information.<br><br>A laugh is heard from the border patrol guard<br><br>Border Patrol Guard: Oh yeah? Then how about you show some identification, and then explain where the stickers are proving it on your truck.<br><br>Driver 2: I can get you the identification and the reason there isn’t an identification sticker doesn't matter for you this was manufactured in America and doesn't need one.<br><br>Border Patrol Guard: Well, if you’re going to drive through Canada you’ll need to have a sticker next time but the identification checks out, Can I check in the back just to be safe?<br><br>Driver 2: No you can't, it's highly classified stuff.<br><br>Border Patrol Guard: Okay I guess, will you be able to pull aside into that station over there while I contact someone from the American Embassy just to ensure that I am not able to search your truck, for safety reasons you know?<br><br>Driver 2: Yeah I understand fully, so just at that spot over there right?<br><br>Border Patrol Guard: Yep, we’ll let you get going as fast as we can, thanks for being this cooperative most people are just like oh I work for the U.S. Government, you can’t tell me what to do, why should I have to wait?<br><br>Bother people laugh for a second<br>Border Patrol Guard: Yeah thanks again we’ll try to make it quick for you<br><br>A bang is heard on the side of the car door again and the truck is heard pulling over onto the side of the road and then the engine is turned of followed by the window to the containment cell being closed<br><br>Driver 2: Hey Wade, we’re being told to wait here for a moment by border patrol, they’re just making sure they are not allowed to search the truck just to be safe, how things going in the back with those things<br><br>Guard: Going pretty good, I could swear I’ve seen them move a bit but it's probably just the lake of sleep finally getting to me.<br><br>Driver 2: Yeah, Iris even was bugging saying that they were fully awake now but I checked the camera and they were all just lying around in a pile just like when we left.<br><br>Guard: Well, they are known for their intelligence and being able to assess and adapt to situations much quicker than any living thing on Earth.<br><br>Driver 2: Yeah I know that, but if they’re knocked out what are they going to do? We’re probably fine, you hear anything from Bob and Mark?<br><br>Guard: Not much, Mark came up to make sure the repair was air tight and then went back into the second trailer to get some rest, and Bob has been knocked out pretty good after driving from Charlottetown to Fredericton, he deserves some rest.<br><br>Driver 2: Yeah, I’ll drive through Maine then I’ll switch with him, I can make it a bit more, plus I love driving along the coast it's just so pretty.<br><br>Guard: I hear ya with that, Just let me know if you want company or anything and I could come up and sit with you, I know these drives can be boring.<br><br>Driver 2: Thanks Wade, but I think I’m alright myself. Oh the border patrol guy is coming back, I’ll talk to you later.<br><br>Guard: Okay talk to you later.<br><br>Border Patrol Guard: So I checked with my guys and they said that you’re good to go, sorry for keeping you here, also we can put a sticker on the back of your trailers if you’re okay with that or we can just let you do it some other time.<br><br>Driver 2: Oh we can do it when we get to our destination, we got a good team they’ll make sure to get it on next time.<br><br>Border Patrol Guard: Okay have a nice trip.<br><br>Driver 2: Thank you and have a great day.<br><br>The truck is heard being turned on and driving away followed after a few minutes by the window being opened again<br><br>There is no communication for an hour<br><br>The truck is heard pulling over to the side of the road<br><br>Driver 2: Hey Wade, I’m going to stretch my legs quickly, that's okay with you?<br><br>Guard: Yeah that’s fine, we’ve been driving for a while I bet you need to.<br><br>Driver 2: Thanks man, I’ll let you know when I get back.<br><br>Guard: Roger that.<br><br>The door is heard being opened and then followed by a loud bang<br><br>Driver 2: What the hell was that?<br><br>Another loud bang is heard followed by shattering glass<br><br>Driver 2: Holy shit, I thought those things were supposed to be asleep?<br><br>There is a creaking noise and the sound of the door being ripped off its hinges followed by a loud thud and roar of a Keras Mimos.<br><br>Guard: Jack what's going on up there?<br><br>A creature roars and the radio is heard being destroyed with a crackling noise. A person is heard running away screaming followed shortly by one of the Keras Mimos roaring and all three of the Keras Mimos following them.<br><br>End of log<br><br>The truck was found the next day with the entire front cabin destroyed and the two trailers intact, the corpse of Jack Smith was found mutilated with only his head and parts of his torso intact, Bob, Mark, and Wade were found slightly injured. Mark had a broken foot, Bob wasn’t injured and Wade had a broken leg and a few broken ribs.<br><br><br>The following are entries found in the diary of a seven year old girl who was one of the victims of the incident. It was found in her bedroom on her nightstand.<br><br><br>April seventeen 2048<br>Julia sween<br><br>Dear Diary,<br>My dad told me there was a car crash accident yesterday when he got back from work. I hope that everyone is okay. Daddy said that there was some people hurt but they will get better soon. Aunty Elizabeth said she will be coming down soon to visit us! It has been a few years since I last saw her because of her new promotion, I am hoping we are able to go shopping together and maybe even go to the beach together! I will write tomorrow after dinner.<br><br>April eighteen 2048<br>Julia sween<br><br>Dear Diary, <br>My latest art project at school got selected to be hung up at town hall! My mom and dad brought me out to dinner at Helen’s Resteraunt to celebrate! I got myself a cheeseburger and a rootbeer! Recently I have been seeing some people walking around in the forest behind my house. I told my daddy and he said that they were people hunting birds probably. I will write tommorow sometime.<br><br>April nineteen 2048<br>Julia sween<br><br>Dear Diary,<br>Aunt Elizabeth is here! She said that she has a few things to do for work here but she’ll try to spend as much time as she can with me! She asked me to talk about the hunters I saw in the woods which confused me a bit but she’s probabl just curious on whats going on cause its been a while. We talked for most of the afternoon and she took me out on a private puffin watching trip so we could hang out and because she has never seen a puffin before.She said that tomorrow she will be working but she will take the day off Thursady so we can hang out and do whatever we want. I will write tomorrow after I get home from school.<br><br>April Twentyif 2048<br>Julia sween<br><br>Dear Diary,<br>I saw one of the hunters outside my house today. They were wearing some kind of black clothing yet they didn’t have any weapons. I found that a bit weird but mommy said it wasn’t anything to be worried about. School was soooooooooooo boring today, we were learning about romans and stuff and it’s so stupid, I mean they all died so long ago who cares about what they say, plus they’re obviously wrong about the gods and stuff because floods arent cause of some old guy underwater who gets mad at you for not killing your pets or family members, I just find it stupid and it's really complicated and I don’t understand it well. I will write tomorrow after lunch.<br><br>April Twenty First 2048<br>Julia sween<br><br>Dear Diary,<br>On my walk to school I saw one of the hunters on the outside of the woods so I waved to them and he ran away, I probably scared away the birds, I feel so bad I should probably give them a sorry card if I get a chance. My teacher has been concerned about the drawings I’ve been making recently because they have monsters or something, I dont really understand I have just been drawing the woods and some of the things I have been seeing. I will write tomorrow after dinner.<br><br>April Twenty Secon 2048<br>Julia sween<br><br>Dear Diary,<br> My mom and I have been planning some things we can do with Aunt  tomorrow when she comes over! We are going to go shoping, go to the beach, and watch a movie! I am so excited for tomorrow. My dad recently has been at work a lot more because he has had to deal a lot of hurt people recently, he wont be home tomorrow sadly but Aunty Elizabeth said she would try to visit again on saturday so that she can see my dad again. I will write again tomorrow after I get back with Aunt Elizabeth.<br><br>April Twenty Three 2048<br>Julia sween<br><br>Dear Diary,<br>We had so much fun together with Aunty Elizabeth we bought some clothes and Aunt Elizabeth bought me a new Diary! I will start writing in it next week, I want to finish this one first. We saw a movie about someone going into space and befriending aliens to get back to earth. We went to the beach afterwards and we saw some whales in the distance. I had a lot of fun with Aunt Elizabeth and I can’t wait till I see her again. I will write again tomorrow whenever I get a chance<br><br>April Twenty fourth 2048<br>Julia sween<br><br>Dear Diary,<br>Today was pretty boring. Not much has happened. Dad said he may be able to get home tonight, I hope he does. I want to show him some of my more recent drawings, in fact I hear him outside, I will be right back. I will write what happened later.<br><br>Julia sween’s was seen from neighbors security cameras going into the woods with some paper in her hands. A few minutes later a quick scream was heard that could’ve belonged to her. Her body was never found, there were blood trails around the woods by her house but nothing was found. There were some drawings in her room that resembled the Keras Mimos which were probably the hunters she mentioned.<br><br>There was an order from a Class-A to search the surrounding woods for the body and to try and neutralize the Keras Mimos if found to prevent any further casualties and to send therapists to the town to comfort the family of Julia sween and any other families that their family members or pets were killed. There were a total of three children who died in a similar way to Julia sween only one of the bodies were found with only their torso and left arm left impaled on a tree branch in the woods, a dog was also killed with its guts ripped open layed out in the backyard of the family.<br><br>Audio Log of Task Force Tango-1<br>Goal of mission: Neutralize all instances of Keras Mimos and make sure no more casualties happen.<br>Approved by: Elizabeth Sween Class-A Personal<br>Members: Abel G, Barney C, Leah W, Stephen S, Chester V, Laura D, Scarlett C<br><br>Leah W: Okay, we’ve had three human casualties so far and we don’t want any more to happen okay? So we are going to spread out and do a search of the woods from here to here, we are going to be spread out about ten feet each to prevent any surprise attacks on us and there is always someone nearby in case they do try to attack us. Remember, make as little noise as possible and shoot the Keras Mimos on sight.<br><br>Abel G: What would happen if they just come up from our sides and silently take out our sides so that the rest of us don’t notice?<br><br>Chester V: That will never happen, don’t worry they’re just stupid animals<br><br>Abel G: They have an average recorded IQ of two hundread fifty. These things could probably figure out twenty ways to kill all of us if we’re not careful Chester.<br><br>Chester V: Oh shut up, you’re always too worried about this stuff just find them and shoot them, what's the worst that could happen?<br><br>Abel G: These things escaped a transportation truck making them our first ever breach of an alien species from containment, they killed the driver and seriously injured the others in the truck, they also killed three kids and someone's dog here without being seen once by anyone but the kids their stalking, the worst that could happen is them killing all of us!<br><br>Leah W: Shut up, both of you! We are going to make a line formation with no more than ten feet between each person to make sure that we won’t have any casualties. We also have been granted permission to use two waist mounted turrets which together will make quick work of these things. Abel and Barney, you two will go next to me with the waist mounted turrets, Laura and Stephen you two will follow behind us a few feet watching our backs and Chester and Scarlett will cover our flanks, everyone understands and does anyone have any questions? Good, then let's go.<br><br>No important communication happens for the next twenty minutes.<br><br>The noise of tree branches cracking is heard<br><br>Leah W: Everyone our mission is done, we’ve been told to turn back and to come back when there are additional reinforcements.<br><br>Gunshots are heard followed by a high pitched distorted scream<br><br>There is silence for another minute<br><br>Chester V: WHAT TH-!?<br><br>More gunshots are heard followed by the screaming of Chester V. The Heavy-WM-8 Turrets are heard being spun and firing followed by the screaming of a Keras Mimos.<br><br>Barney C:  Yeah, that's what I’m talking about! One down two to go<br><br>Leah W: Laura and Stephen go back to see if you can find remains of Chester, we will keep going looking for the other two Keras Mimos, good luck to you two. <br><br>The sound of two people walking away is heard<br><br>Leah W: Move forward, five foot distance between us, watch eachothers backs.<br><br>There is silence other than the occasional branch snap or bird chirping in the distance<br><br><br>The sound of something running fast is heard followed by something hitting the ground<br><br>Scarlett C: GET THE FUCK OFF ME!<br><br>Gunshots are heard with more screaming and branches being snapped then silence<br><br>Leah W: Abel, stay here, we need you she’s already gone, I’m sorry.<br><br>Abel G: You’ve gotta be fucking kidding me! It attacked her and used her as a human shield! That thing deserves to die<br><br>Leah W: Abel if you go out there by yourself they will kill you and I know she wouldn't want that to happen to you, so stay here and stay in formation got it?<br><br>Abel G: But w- <br><br>A deep sigh is here<br><br>Abel G: Fine, whatever you say.<br><br>Leah W: Good, okay if you need any emotional help later I can get you someone to talk to. Let’s keep moving, Abel and Barney switch the turrets to shoot anything that isn’t in our system. If a few birds or deer die it won't be a big deal to the ecosystem here, plus we can just introduce a few more.<br><br>Barney: Roger that.<br><br>The sound of buttons being pressed followed by a low high frequency quiet hum.<br><br>There is silence for the next few minutes<br><br>Branches cracking are heard<br><br>Stephen S: We’re back, don’t shoot! We found Chester;s remains, there wasn’t anything left except for his jacket, his dog tag, and his pistol. Everything else was all ripped apart and there were no remains of his body found.<br><br>Barney C: God, and he was about to have his first kid. His wife will be devastated.<br><br>Shooting and screaming is heard and two loud thuds. The sound of metal being bent and banging is heard followed by more silence.<br><br>Barney C: That thing destroyed my sentry! How the hell did it do that so quickly? Ow fuck, and my arms broken as well, that’s good to know. Hey Laura, could you go with me back to the camp? I'm gonna need medical attention soon.<br><br>Laura D: Sure thing Barney, I can help you make a splint if that’s okay with you Leah.<br><br>Leah W: It’s fine with me, just make sure you guys both are watching each other's backs, I don't want another casualty out here.<br><br><br>Laura D: Understood, thank you Leah, let’s go Barney.<br><br>Barney C: Okay, good luck guys and see you back at camp.<br><br>The sound of people walking away is heard followed by silence other than the quiet hum of the Heavy-WM-8 Turret<br><br>Abel G: Why don’t we just run around and make a lot of noise and try to challenge it? These things are smart but they don’t have any armor so my turret can easily blow its torso apart and kill it, how does that sound?<br><br>Leah W: I guess it could work, These things have just been throwing themselves at us and dying pretty easily, so shouldn’t be that big of a problem but what if we scare it away with the loud noises?<br><br>Abel G: These are smart creatures, if they hear a lot of noise they will most likely try and find the source of the sound and see if it’s a threat to their dominance in the area or if they are an easy kill, so they would try and fight us to get us out of their territory. I was part of mission Acid Geyser, I know how to deal with smart aggressive creatures.<br><br>Leah W: Whatever you say I guess. It makes sense and it doesn’t sound like there is much that could go wrong. Let's do a Keilerkopf formation, Abel will lead, Stephen and I will follow you in the rear, we will watch your back, remember no communication so we can tell if that thing is trying to mimic us, let's go.<br><br>The sound of branches cracking and people walking is heard with occasional sounds of animals in the distance<br><br>The sound of something running is heard and gunshots are heard followed by screaming of pain and a roar from the Keras Mimos and the sound of running is heard followed by more gunshots then silence.<br><br>Abel G: We did it, with only three casualties, that's a new record for me.<br><br>Stephen S: Don’t act like this wasn’t a big deal, we just had our first ever containment breach on Earth, three casualties, and two of the creatures using us as human shields! For goodness sakes that thing just killed Leah right in front of us and you don’t even want to mention that?<br><br>Abel G: It isn’t that big of a deal, casualties happen all the time, I can bring her body back to the camp and inform them on what happened.<br><br>Stephen S: God you have no soul, but whatever you say.<br><br>End of log<br><br>All 3 Keras Mimos were successfully terminated with four casualties of, Jack M, Leah W, Chester V, and Scarlett C, there were a total of four civilian casualties.
